Prototypes:

Every funxrion in JA is known as prototype property., which is an object that contains the properties and methoes that are always avaliable for each instance of an object.

Navigator Object:

This gives you access to various properties of the viewer's browerses, such as name, version. It's part of windows object, which means you can access its properties using window.navigator.property.
Sames as alert = window.alert("Hello World!");

--

History Object:

The hisorty object, which is also part of the window object, provides information on the browser history of the current window.

--

DOM - Document Object Model
Document object is an object that is created by the browser or each new HTML page(document) that is viewed.

Dom allows JS to access the structure of the document in the browser. Each document is mad up of structured nodes(example body, elements in body would be child nodes od the body element)

Figure 9-1
<body>
<h1>My Page</h1>
<image src="myimage.jpg" alt="my pic">
</body>

9-1 
Body is a node
h1 and image elements are both child nodes of the body elements. Each element also has its own nodes.
h1 - text node
img = 2 attribute nodes. 

--

Collection:

A number of the properties(anchor,forms, images) return an array that holds a collection of element or values found in the doc. Can be access liek an array using index. index[0] = first

-- 

Property of the Doc Obj

anchors - returns an array of all named anchors in the doc.
form - return array of all the form elements in the doc
...... more property avaliable

What's an Even Handler?
An even thnadler is a predinded JavasCript property of an object. Used to handle an event on a web page.

--

The Event Object
an object named event is created, which stores information about the event.
event, IE uses window.event which means DOM level 0 event handerl would use the following code:
var e = event || window.event;

property:
bubbles - whether or not the event bubbles
cancelable : default action of the event can be canceled?
cancelBubble - Cancels event bubbling when set to false(I.E)
currentTarget- the element that is currently handling the even
defaultPrevented - whether preventDefault() has been called

Window: The Global Object
Window object is created for each window that appears in the browser. Can be a frame set, or individual frame, a tab, or new window created with JS. windows obj contains document object(as well as other obj, such as history, navigator ...)It serves as the global object for JS in the Web browser. 

Properties of the Window Obj:
applicationCache
closed
console
content
defaultStatus
document
frameElement
frames
history
location,
navagator
outerHeight
screen
status
window
....much more


Methods of the Window Obj:
addEventListener()
alert()
back()
blur()
close()
confirm()
resizeTo()
scrollTo()
print();

The main browser window is often proteced from being moved, resized, closed, or otherwise manipulate for ssecurity reasons. Example, open a bad site while clsoing the main window. Many of the methods mentioned such as resizeTo don't do any;thin wwhen called in the main window or display a warnin to the view. Browsers allow you more control of pop-up window.

Caution- some browser doesn't allow resizeTo or moveTo. some open in a new tab or in main browser rather tahn popup.

Date Object

JavaScript predefined object. To use this object, you need to create an instance of the object to which you can refer

var time = new Date(); //default date is current date.
var past = new Date("November 5,1955"); //speficiy past date

--

String Object

String Obj != String literal. String Liter only has value. String Obj is an object value.Obj contains name-value pair
var s1 = "a";
var s2 = "a";
true s1 == s3

when string literal uses string obj method, a temp strin obj will be returned.


var s1 = new String("a");
var s2 = new String("a");
s1 != s2 because they're comparing the object value.  They're not the same object.

Properties of String Object
charAt() - Finds out which char is at a given position in a string
charcodeAt() - Same as charAt() except finding a char code
conccat() 
slice(start,end-up to but not included) - Pulls out a specified section of a string value and returns a new string
substr() - a portion of string specified with a string position and ending after a certain number of chars to be returned.
substring() - 
indexOf()
lastIndexOf()
toLowerCase()
toUppercase()
toString()
fromCharCode()
localeCompare()
match() return array. else -1
replace()
split()
search()

Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on the end usere's computer. 

cookies must be 4KB(4000 characters) each or less.
A browser can accept up to only 20 cookies from a single domain.
If a number of viewers don't accept cookies, this eliminates any advantages of your cookie(s) to those vieweres

Benefit: help users browse site more effectively. Alert only initiali visiters

Setting a cookie
-Give a value to the cookie property of the document object.
-restriction , no spaces, commas, or semicolons in the string

Example: document.cookie = "name=tasty1&fav=sugar"

encodeURIComponent - escape space, commas or semicolons. Cookie accept charater codes, as a CGI program oftend does.  might look like %20 , %41. The method is under window object.

var thetext = "name=tasty1&fav=chocolate chip";
newtext = encodeURIComponent(thetext);
document.cookie = newtext;


set an expiration Date
Add a small bit of code to make it expire
expdate = ";expires=Mon, 30 Mar 2015 13:00:00 UTC";
newtext = codeURIComponent(thetext)
newtext += expdate;
document.cookie = newtext;

Read a cookie
 var mycookie = document.cookie;
 fixed_cookie = decodeURIComponent(mycookie));
 pairs = fixed_cookoie.split("&");
 name_propoval = name.split("=");

 name_propoval[0] - value of name
 name_propoval[1] - value of tastyl

 --

 Regular Expresions
 more power to handle stings in a script. It allow you to form patterns that can nbe matched against string 

 To create a RegExp literal
 var varname = /pattern/flags <-- g,i,m

 var tomatch = /our/
 is_a_match = tomatch.test("pour");

 if(is_a_match)

Methods
replace()
match() It returns an array containing one or more matches, depending on how it's used. -1 if not found.
search(), If found, position in the string where the begining of the match was found otherwise -1 returns.


--
